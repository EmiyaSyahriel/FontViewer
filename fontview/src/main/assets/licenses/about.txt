Quick, simple, small, less-featured font viewer for Android.
Aiming to be Android version of Windows Font Preview, except that this app cannot install font to system, that is other app's responsibility.

The reason I made this app is that there is no fully "free" font viewer in Play Store that is still usable in my devices. Some of them were
unnecessarily big, some with ads, some uses WebView, some were old and incompatible with my devices, some gives too much feature that I might not need.

Features :
- Can be set as default "Open with" app
    - Also include unique file icon for file managers that supports it
- Uses Android File Chooser, No standalone file selector that requires entire filesystem permission
- Native Android UI, Looks like an app that belongs to your phone instead of those over-beautified alien UI
- No internet necessary and no user data is collected by the app itself
    - Links clicked in this apps will be opened in browser, which needs internet and those links might requires some of your data.
- Small, release version is less than megabytes of storage
    - We uses small amount of dependency, not even AndroidX and Jetpack were used.
- Supports from Android 4.4 up to Android 13
