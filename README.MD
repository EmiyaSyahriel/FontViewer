# Font Viewer
Quick, simple, small, less-featured font viewer for Android. 
Aiming to be Android version of Windows Font Preview, except that this app cannot install font to system, that is other app's responsibility.

## How to use
1. Open a font file in file manager
   - Usually third-party file manager supports this
   - Some vendor-made file manager did not support it
   - Some browser did not allow opening downloaded file that is not media or document file
2. Start the app from Launcher, will open file chooser at beginning

## Supported type
Any font is supported by Android Typeface class and Typecast library
